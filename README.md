Converts a folder of mp4s to a folder of mp3s

I was working on a side project this past weekend and I got very tired not finding a way to convert mp4 files to mp3 that fit my workflow. 
I though this very simple tool I wrote over a bowl of grape nuts might be helpful for someone. Might add a bit more functionality later.

How to use:

1. Input the folder directory for your existing mp4s file in mp4_folder_location. (example: "G:\mp4")
2. Input the folder directory for where the mp3 file will be converted and stored into at variable mp3_folder_location. (example : "G:\mp3_converted")
3. run
